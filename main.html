	<h1>GOA</h1>
	<p>Famous for its pristine beaches, hippie vibes, laidback lifestyle, and vibrant parties, Goa is counted among the best holiday destinations in India. The union territory is frequented by tourists year-round, especially in the winter season when the climate is pleasant, and the entire place comes alive with Christmas and New Year celebrations. Goa is definitely one of the top 5 tourist places in India. However, seasoned tourists do not shun Goa during summer either. If you are looking for a peaceful and economical holiday, try to visit Goa during the offseason when the sun-kissed beaches, flea markets, and other attractions are less crowded.</p>
